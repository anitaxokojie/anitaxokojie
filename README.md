### Featured Projects
**1. Legal Document Relevance Assessment (Field Project)**
*   Developed a multi-stage information retrieval system for legal e-discovery, creating "atomic units" from hundreds of thousands of documents to enhance review efficiency.
*   Integrated Google Gemini 1.5-flash for LLM-based thematic extraction and a custom PageRank algorithm, achieving a **mean F1 score of 0.840** (LLM + TF-IDF) for relevance.
* Optimized API calls and semantic similarity calculations via intelligent caching, reducing costs by **73%** and ensuring **99%+ evaluation completion** while identifying **47.6% cross-domain performance degradation**.
*   **Technologies:** Python, Google Gemini 1.5-flash API, NetworkX, scikit-learn, BM25

**2. Multilingual Extractive Summarization**
*   Engineered a BERT-based extractive summarization system for 1,000+ TED Talk transcripts in English & Spanish, achieving **ROUGE-1 F1 of 0.3078 and BLEU-1 of 0.2281**.
*   Implemented language-specific preprocessing and domain-specific boosting, leading to a **40% speed improvement** and **27% enhanced topic fidelity**.
*   Conducted fairness analysis, identifying **biases towards technology content** (+20.5% length) and **underrepresentation of society-focused talks** (-19% length), informing ethical AI development.
*   **Technologies:** Python, Transformers, spaCy, PageRank, NLTK, LIME

**3. Fake News Detection with Hybrid ML**
*   Designed and implemented a hybrid ML system combining transformer embeddings with linguistic analysis for fake news detection, achieving **94.03% accuracy**.
*   Engineered a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline (readability, sentiment, lexical diversity) and novel fusion methods to optimally integrate signals.
*   Developed interpretability modules using LIME for transparent feature visualization, identifying linguistic markers and **revealing more polarized sentiment in fake news** (-0.257 vs -0.016).
*   **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers, VADER, scikit-learn, LIME

**4. Big Data E-commerce Analytics**
*   Developed a distributed big data analytics solution using Apache Spark for 500,000+ e-commerce records across 7 tables, demonstrating horizontal scalability.
*   Implemented customer segmentation via K-means clustering (identifying High-Value Loyal, High-Value Occasional, Low-Engagement segments) and an ALS collaborative filtering recommendation system achieving **0.82 RMSE**.
*   Conducted product performance analytics, identifying Electronics with the **highest profit margin (49.7%)** and pinpointing 27 high-selling products with critical inventory levels.
*   **Technologies:** PySpark, MLlib, Hadoop, SQL, Alternating Least Squares
